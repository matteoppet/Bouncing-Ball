# Bouncing ball

The bouncing ball project is a simulation where you launch a ball everywhere and it simulates
its movements realistically using physics. You can add random objects to interact with.

## To-Do
- [x] 1. Create ball
- [x] 2. Simulate downwards force (gravity * mass)
- [x] 3. Detect collisions (window boundaries)
- [x] 4. Simulates opposite force (force making it bouncing)
- [ ] 5. Spawn ball with left click mouse
- [ ] 6. Add vertical velocity adaption to the physics calculations
- [ ] 7. Create other object
- [ ] 8. Detect collision with new objects
- [ ] 9. Simulate force when colliding with other objects (diagonal, vertical, horizontal)
- [ ] 10. Spawn objects in-game feature
- [ ] 11. Draw path line of where the ball travelled
