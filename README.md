# Bouncing ball
In this project there is a ball and this collides and bounce back depending on which side of the object will collide.
The ball can be spawned by left-clicking in any part of the window, instead, with right-click, you can spawn a rectangle where the ball will collide with.

The physics of the ball bouncing and free-falling is done by an example of a physics engine. This project does not utilize any physics engine; The library used for the graphic is name [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

This project was only done to increase my physics and c++ knowledge.

### How to run it?
Just clone the repository and run the **make** command (if you have it).
